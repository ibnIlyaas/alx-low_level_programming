What goes around definitely comes around. 
Recursion is the idea that the solution to a problem lies in smaller instances of the particular problem. 
Recursion is not only about going round in circles, but doing so with meaning of some sort. 
A recursive function is said to be one that calls itself.
This directory expounds more on Recursion with instances. :)
